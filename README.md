MNIST with cookiecutter organisation
==============================

M6 exercise.

The way to run this project is as follow:

>make data
will do the data preprocessing. It will run `src/data/make_dataset.py` and will take the data from `data/raw` and process into `data/processed`.

>make train
will train the data in  `data/processed` and returns the model in `models/trained_model`. I'll think of a way to have multiple model and chose them in the argument.

>make evaluate
will make prediction on generated example from the test set `data/examples/example_images.npy`.
